APPROACH
------
*The Regex Testers which are already available are quite challenging for non-technical persons. So we decided 
to solve this problem and make regex query tool easier for a common person. Anyone can find and replace any 
word in few seconds now. The main advantage of this tool which is quite unique is the support of files. Our 
tool support files like CSV, TXT, XLSX. Also we add a feature for users so they can interact with us. We tried to 
make it as much user friendly as possible to recover those problems. Hope this will help a user and user can 
save immense time by using this tool.*
